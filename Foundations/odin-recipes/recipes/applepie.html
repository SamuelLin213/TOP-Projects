    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one
       quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several
       first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
       favorites as well!</p>
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
       <li>1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie</li>
       <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
       <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
       <li>¼ cup water</li>
       <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
       <li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
       <li>8 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a
          saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and
          brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.</li>
        <li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
          slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and
          butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.</li>
        <li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350
          degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes,
          until apples are soft.</li>
      </ol>
